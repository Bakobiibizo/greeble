"""
Greeble Core

Purpose:
    CSS tokens, resets, and minimal utility classes consumed by components.

Inputs:
    - None at runtime for Python; this package primarily ships static assets.

Outputs:
    - CSS files (e.g., greeble-core.css) to be included in app pages.

Dependencies:
    - None required; integrates with any framework via <link> tags.

Notes:
    This module intentionally contains no runtime code. Static assets live under
    `packages/greeble_core/assets/`.
